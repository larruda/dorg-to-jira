## Installation

Download the PHAR somewhere in your filesystem. 
If you want it globally available move it to a directory listed in your system's $PATH environment variable.
You can optionally rename the file and remove the .phar extension, so it's more like a "real bin".

Below is an example using OSX or Linux:

```sh
curl -O https://github.com/larruda/dorg-to-jira/releases/download/0.0.1/dorg-to-jira.phar
mv dorg-to-jira.phar /usr/local/bin/dorg-to-jira
```

## Usage 

A few motivating and useful examples of how your product can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially more screenshots.

## Build from source

I'm assuming you have Composer installed and globally available on your OS.
If that's not the case, follow the instructions at [https://getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org).
With composer properly installed and functional, clone this repository, cd into it and download all dependencies.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:larruda/dorg-to-jira.git
cd dorg-to-jira/
composer install
```

After that and considering no errors have been thrown, go ahead and build the PHAR archive.
If you are curious about what this do underneath or need to debug step-by-step, read the project's [composer.json](composer.json).

```sh
composer run-script build-phar
```

You should have a *dorg-to-jira.phar* inside a *bin/* directory in the project root.
